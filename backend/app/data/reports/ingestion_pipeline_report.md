# World leaders adopt a historic global declaration on noncommunicable diseases and mental health
16 December 2025
News release
New York
Reading time: 3 min (847 words)
Leaders from across the world at the Eightieth United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) have adopted the political declaration to combat noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health challenges through a fully integrated approach. This is the outcome of the intergovernmental negotiations in advance of and considered by the fourth high-level meeting of the UNGA on the prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and well-being, held on 25 September 2025.   

Titled **.** This step is expected to usher in a new era in addressing some of the world’s most pressing health challenges – affecting people of all ages and income levels across the globe.  

Today’s leading causes of death – NCDs – claim 18 million lives prematurely each year, while mental health conditions affect over a billion people globally. NCDs are often driven by preventable risk factors such as unhealthy diets, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and air pollution – many of which also negatively impact mental health. Both NCDs and mental health conditions are increasing in every country, affecting every community. That makes them urgent issues not only for public health, but also for productivity and sustainable economic growth.
### A new era with measurable targets****  

Marking a significant evolution from previous commitments, the new political declaration establishes three first-ever global "fast-track" outcome targets to be achieved by 2030:  

  * 150 million fewer tobacco users;
  * 150 million more people with hypertension under control; and
  * 150 million more people with access to mental health care.  



To ensure countries can reach these goals, the declaration also sets ambitious, measurable process targets for national systems by 2030, including:  

  * at least 80% of countries with policy, legislative, regulatory and fiscal measures in place;
  * at least 80% of primary health care facilities with access to affordable, WHO-recommended essential medicines and basic technologies for NCDs and mental health;
  * at least 60% of countries implementing financial protection policies or measures that cover or limit the cost of essential NCD and mental health services;
  * at least 80% of countries with operational, multisectoral national plans for NCDs and mental health; and
  * at least 80% of countries with robust surveillance and monitoring systems for NCDs and mental health.


"The adoption of these bold targets to control noncommunicable diseases and promote mental health is a testament to the commitment of Member States to protect the health of their people,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Together, we can change the trajectory of NCDs and mental health, and deliver health, well-being and opportunity for all."  

### The most far-reaching declaration yet for scope and commitments
This political declaration is the most comprehensive to date, integrating lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and responding to new global challenges. Its unprecedented scope includes many pressing issues addressed for the first time, such as:
  * broader NCD areas: oral health, lung health, childhood cancer, liver disease, kidney disease, and rare diseases;
  * expanded environmental determinants: air pollution, clean cooking, lead exposure, and hazardous chemicals; and
  * evolving risk of digital harms: social media exposure, excessive screen time, harmful content, and the risks of mis- and disinformation.


The political declaration reflects a sharper regulatory focus on e-cigarettes, novel tobacco products, unhealthy food marketing to children, front-of-pack labeling, and the elimination of trans fats. Its commitments are grounded in a strong equity argument, including the expertise and the needs of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions, climate-vulnerable populations, Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and those in humanitarian settings.
### Financing and a whole-of-society approach in a challenging landscape
Acknowledging strained economic conditions that threaten health financing worldwide, the declaration features stronger financing language than its predecessors by urging countries to secure adequate, predictable and sustained funding through increased domestic financing, strengthened international partnerships, and coordinated multilateral frameworks. 
The political declaration firmly positions NCDs and mental health as not merely health concerns, but as central pillars for achieving sustainable development and social justice. It underscores that solutions require a “whole-of-government” and “whole-of-society” approach, engaging civil society, partners, youth, persons with disabilities, and people with lived experience.   

### Looking ahead: a framework for accountability
This declaration builds on and strengthens the three previous declarations and charts a new course of action toward a healthier, more equitable and prosperous future. The text confirms the need to ensure accountability mechanisms that can demonstrate and sustain impact. 
The UN Secretary-General will report on progress towards these targets by 2030, ahead of the next High-Level Meeting. WHO, along with UN agencies, will support Member States in translating these historic commitments into national action, ensuring accountability from now until 2030 and beyond.
### Editor’s note  

WHO defines premature death as death that occurs before the average age of death in a certain population and will vary around the world. We defined premature death at a global level as 70 years.

# World AMR Awareness Week 2025 urges action to turn political commitments into life-saving interventions
17 November 2025
Departmental update
Reading time: 2 min (445 words)
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is widespread and increasing, threatening decades of medical progress and putting the health of people, animals, plants, and ecosystems at risk. Antibiotics that once reliably cured common infections are rapidly losing effectiveness. AMR is already responsible for more than a million deaths each year, with the toll expected to climb in the coming decades. 
As 
“All counties are faced with antimicrobial resistance. Drug-resistant pathogens are increasing everywhere, and the less access people have to prevention, diagnosis, and appropriate treatment, the more likely they are to suffer from drug-resistant infections,” said Dr Yvan Hutin, Director of Antimicrobial Resistance at WHO. “World AMR Awareness Week reminds us that protecting antimicrobials is a shared responsibility. We must act now to safeguard these life-saving medicines for ourselves and for future generations.” 
AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial agents. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents become ineffective and infections become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. 
Because AMR crosses borders and sectors, coordinated action is essential. World AMR Awareness Week urges policy-makers, health workers, veterinarians, farmers, environmental and wastewater professionals, researchers, civil society, and communities to work together. Whether it’s a hospital administrator setting up an antimicrobial stewardship team or a farmer adopting sustainable waste management practices, every action counts. 
The campaign, held annually, aims to: 
  * raise awareness and understanding of AMR; 
  * promote global action to tackle the emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens; and 
  * advocate for concrete actions in response to AMR, building on the WHA resolution, 2024 UNGA High-level Meeting on AMR and the fourth Global High-Level Ministerial Conference on AMR. 


Governments, civil society organizations, health partners, and communities are encouraged to organize campaigns during World AMR Awareness Week. The AMR Quadripartite organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), WHO, and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), provide advocacy and technical materials to support these activities on the 
Together, we can keep antimicrobials effective and build a healthier, more sustainable world for generations to come.

# World Children’s Day Message 2025 - “My Day, My Rights”
## WHO highlights need for accelerated action to protect children from major communicable diseases
20 November 2025
Departmental update
Geneva
Reading time: 3 min (680 words)
As the world marks World Children’s Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for decisive, accelerated action to uphold the rights of every child, regardless of nationality, community, or circumstance, to health, protection and life-saving care. Every child has the right to health, protection, education, life-saving care, and to have their voice heard. Yet millions of children and adolescents are still falling ill and dying from preventable diseases - including HIV, tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) - that continue to rob them of their futures.
In 2024 alone, an estimated 1.4 million children and adolescents (0–14 years) were living with HIV (or 2.4 million 0-19 years)__ and 120,000 children 0-14 years were newly infected with HIV.__ Around 1.2 million children and young adolescents (0-14 years) fell ill with TB, and over 170,000 children died, most under five years of age. STIs also pose a significant but often under-recognized threat to adolescents. Despite limited data, major STIs share the same behavioural, social and structural determinants as HIV, underscoring the need for integrated prevention, testing and treatment approaches. Chronic hepatitis B affects 254 million people globally, with 12% of infections occurring in children, largely due to mother-to-child transmission and early childhood exposure. While vaccination has reduced hepatitis B prevalence in children under five to below 1%, major gaps persist: only 45% of newborns worldwide receive the crucial hepatitis B birth-dose vaccine within 24 hours of birth. Without timely prevention and treatment, hepatitis can lead to lifelong liver disease and cancer. 
Children and adolescents, especially those living with infectious diseases, coupled with malnutrition, poverty, conflict or marginalization, continue to face unacceptable delays in diagnosis, barriers to treatment, and limited access to preventive services.
“Ending TB, HIV, hepatitis and STIs in children and adolescents is a matter of justice,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director - WHO Department for HIV, TB, hepatitis & STIs. “Every child and young person deserves a healthy start in life. By ending these diseases, we are not only saving lives - we are securing a future where every child can thrive.”
**WHO support to countries**
WHO is working closely with countries worldwide to accelerate progress against TB, HIV, hepatitis and STIs in children and adolescents:
  * HIV, Hepatitis and STIs:
  * Tuberculosis: Through the 
  * Youth leadership: WHO’s 


On Children’s Day, WHO calls on governments, communities and partners to put children and adolescents at the centre of national health agendas and to meaningfully engage young people in shaping the services that protect them from preventable diseases such as TB, HIV, hepatitis and STIs.

#  COVID-19 - Global Situation 
## Disease Outbreak News
28 May 2025
### Situation at a glance
Since mid-February 2025, according to data available from sentinel sites, global SARS-CoV-2 activity has been increasing, with the test positivity rate reaching 11%, levels that have not been observed since July 2024. This rise is primarily observed in countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Since early 2025, global SARS-CoV-2 variant trends have slightly shifted. Circulation of LP.8.1 has been declining, and reporting of NB.1.8.1, a Variant Under Monitoring (VUM), is increasing, reaching 10.7% of global sequences reported as of mid-May. Recent increases in SARS-CoV-2 activity are broadly consistent with levels observed during the same period last year, however, there still lacks a clear seasonality in SARS-CoV-2 circulation, and surveillance is limited. Continued monitoring is essential. WHO advises all Member States to continue applying a risk-based, integrated approach to managing COVID-19 as outlined in the Director-General’s Standing Recommendations [1]. As part of comprehensive COVID-19 control programmes, vaccination remains a key intervention for preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19, particularly among at risk groups. 
### Description of the situation
There has been an increase in SARS-CoV-2 activity globally, based on SARS-CoV-2 data reported to the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) from sentinel surveillance sites. As of 11 May 2025, the test positivity rate is 11% across 73 reporting countries, areas and territories. This level matches the peak observed in July 2024 (12% from 99 countries) and marks a rise from 2% reported by 110 countries back in mid-February 2025 (Figure 1). The increase in test positivity rate is mainly being driven by countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the South-East Asia Region, and the Western Pacific Region. 
Countries in the African Region, European Region, and the Region of the Americas are currently reporting low levels of SARS-CoV-2 activity with percent positivity from sentinel or systematic virological surveillance sites ranging from 2% to 3%. However, some areas—particularly in the Caribbean and Andean subregions in the Region of the Americas showed increasing trends of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity as of 11 May. Publicly available wastewater monitoring data from countries in the European Region and the Northern America subregion remain low and, at present, do not indicate any upward trend in SARS-CoV-2 activity as of 11 May 2025.
The reporting of COVID-19 associated hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths is very limited from the countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the South-East Asia Region, and the Western Pacific Region and does not allow for evaluation of the impact on health systems by WHO.

**SARS-CoV-2 Variant Evolution and Circulation**
SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, and between January and May 2025, there were shifts in global SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics. At the beginning of the year, the most prevalent variant tracked by WHO at the global level was XEC, followed by KP.3.1.1. In February, circulation of XEC began to decline while that of LP.8.1 increased, with the latter becoming the most detected variant in mid-March. Since mid-April, the circulation of LP.8.1 has been slightly declining as NB.1.8.1 is increasingly being detected.
**Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest and Variants Under Monitoring proportions from January 2025 to May 2025.**
_Source_ _:__and_
The most recently designated variant under monitoring (VUM) is NB.1.8.1, which is a descendent lineage of XDV.1.5.1, in turn a descendent of JN.1, with the earliest sample collected on 22 January 2025. In comparison to the currently dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1 has the following additional spike mutations: T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. Spike mutations at position 445 have been shown to enhance binding affinity to hACE2 receptor, which could increase the variant’s transmissibility; mutations at position 435 have been shown to modestly reduce the neutralization potency of class 1 and class 1/4 antibodies; mutations at position 478 have been shown to enhance the evasion of Class 1/2 antibodies.[2]
As of 18 May 2025, 518 NB.1.8.1 sequences were submitted to GISAID from 22 countries, representing 10.7% of the globally available sequences in epidemiological week (EW) 17 of 2025 (21 to 27 April 2025). While the percentage remains low, this presents a significant rise from 2.5% four weeks prior in EW14 of 2025 (31 March to 6 April 2025). Between EW14 and EW17 of 2025, increased circulation of NB.1.8.1 was detected in all three WHO regions that are consistently sharing SARS-CoV-2 sequences, i.e. from 8.9% to 11.7% for the Western Pacific region, from 1.6% to 4.9% for the region of the Americas, and from 1.0% to 6.0% for the European region. There are only 5 NB.1.8.1 sequences from the South-East Asia Region, and none from the African Region or the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
**COVID-19 Vaccination Update**
From the latest available global data covering the period between 1 January and 30 September 2024, overall COVID-19 vaccine uptake among high-risk groups remains low, with significant disparities across regions and income levels. Among older adults[3], just 1.68% were reported as having received a dose so far in 2024 up to 30 September 2024 across 75 reporting Member States, and among health and care workers, uptake stood at 0.96% across 54 reporting Member States. An estimated 39.2 million individuals, across 90 reporting Member States covering 31% of the global population, had received a dose in 2024 through 30 September 2024, including 14.8 million in the third quarter. Uptake was notably higher in the Region of the Americas and the European Region, with older adult coverage reaching 5.1% in the European Region and 3.6% in the Region of the Americas compared to less than 0.5% in other regions. A similar disparity was observed when comparing countries by income level. High and upper middle-income countries (HIC/UMIC) reported higher vaccine uptake among older adults with 4.3% and 1.2% respectively, compared to less than 0.5% in low-income countries (LIC) and lower middle-income countries (LMIC). Similar patterns were seen among health and care workers, with uptake in the Region of the Americas (2.8%) far exceeding the less than 0.5% seen in other regions. Among income groups, UMICs reported 2.1% coverage, compared to just 0.3% in LICs and 0.1% in LMICs. Complete vaccination data for 2024 is being collected now and will be released in mid-July 2025. 
Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide protection against severe disease and death. To ensure approved vaccines remain effective, the WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to monitor and review the impact of SARS-CoV-2 evolution on the performance of available vaccines. In May 2025, 
**_Overview of selected WHO regions_**
**Eastern Mediterranean Region**
In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, sentinel surveillance data have been reported from 12 countries via test positivity rates from sentinel sites in 2025. The test positivity rate increased from 4% in EW13 to 17% in EW17 and then declined to 15% in EW19. Following lower circulation in the first ten weeks of 2025, a sharp upward trend surpassed the levels of last year (11% in EW17 2024). Across the region, recent reports of increases in circulation have been observed in five countries to date, including Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.

### Public health response
Since the formal ending of the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in May 2023, Member States have adopted diverse approaches to sustaining COVID-19 and broader coronavirus disease threat management. While some countries have integrated COVID-19 activities into existing respiratory disease programmes, others remain in transitional phases, maintaining targeted vertical interventions while adapting systems and structures for integrated management of infectious diseases. This variation reflects differing national contexts, resource availability, health system capacities and other national priorities.
Routine public health measures for COVID-19 are increasingly being embedded within broader surveillance and response systems. Countries have been moving to operate integrated respiratory disease surveillance platforms – such as eGISRS and 
However, the long-term sustainability of these activities and the financing to support this remain a challenge in many countries. Health systems face an increasing number of competing priorities, including other infectious disease threats, the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, health workforce strain, and the persistent need to recover essential services disrupted during the pandemic. Beyond the health sector, broader societal and economic pressure, such as inflation, political instability, and humanitarian crises, further complicate efforts to maintain COVID-19 disease threat management at scale. WHO and partners continue to support countries in navigating these realities by promoting context-sensitive integration, prioritization, and long-term investment in respiratory disease threat management systems.
WHO continues to support Member States by convening and coordinating global stakeholders and relevant networks, developing evidence-based guidance and policy recommendations, and providing tailored support to assist Member States in building and sustaining core capabilities, in collaboration with other key partners.
### WHO risk assessment
As per the latest WHO global risk assessment, covering the period July-December 2024, the global public health risk associated with COVID-19 remains high. There has been evidence of decreasing impact on human health throughout 2023 and 2024 compared to 2020-2023, driven mainly by: 1) high levels of population immunity, achieved through infection, vaccination, or both; 2) similar virulence of currently circulating JN.1 sublineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as compared with previously circulating Omicron sublineages; and 3) the availability of diagnostic tests and improved clinical case management. SARS-CoV-2 circulation nevertheless continues at considerable levels in many areas, as indicated in regional trends, without any established seasonality and with unpredictable evolutionary patterns. WHO produces global COVID-19 risk assessments every six months; the global risk assessment covering the period January-June 2025 is currently under development. 
WHO continues to monitor emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and undertakes risk evaluation for designated variants of interest (VOI) and VUMs with the support of the Technical Advisory Group of Virus Evolution (TAG-VE). Evaluation of the currently predominant VUM, 
To permit robust COVID-19 risk assessment and management, WHO reiterates its recommendations to Member States to continue to monitor and report SARS-CoV-2 activity and burden, public health and healthcare system impacts of COVID-19, strengthen genomic sequencing capacity and reporting, in particular information on SARS-CoV-2 variants [6], promptly and transparently to support global public health efforts.
### WHO advice
WHO advises all Member States to continue applying a risk-based, integrated approach to managing COVID-19, embedded within broader disease prevention and control programmes, in particular those for other respiratory disease threats, in line with the WHO Director-General’s Standing Recommendations. Sustained investment in core public health capabilities, notably collaborative surveillance, community protection, clinical care, access to and delivery of medical countermeasures, and coordination, is critical to monitoring SARS-CoV-2 circulation and evolution, and mitigating its ongoing health and socioeconomic impacts.
Following the expiration of the last Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) from 2023-2025, WHO has published a high level 
WHO released an updated package of 
  * Maintain multi-source, multi-tiered collaborative surveillance systems for early detection, variant monitoring, and disease burden assessment, using both sentinel and wastewater surveillance, integrated into respiratory pathogen monitoring platforms.[7-8]
  * Ensure continued equitable access to and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among high-risk groups, guided by national immunization strategies aligned with WHO SAGE recommendations.[9-10]
  * Strengthen healthcare delivery systems to ensure high-quality clinical management of COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Condition (PCC), embedded in scalable care models and featuring robust infection prevention and control standards.
  * Enhance risk communication and community engagement to empower individuals to make informed decisions, counter misinformation, and support community-led protection strategies.
  * Institutionalize national and subnational coordination mechanisms, including those developed during the acute phase of the pandemic, into long-term respiratory disease threat management systems, aligned with a One Health approach.


WHO further reminds Member States that the 
WHO recommends that countries remain vigilant, adapt to evolving epidemiological trends, and leverage COVID-19 management strategies to strengthen systems for all respiratory disease threats. Member States should continue offering COVID-19 vaccines in line with WHO recommendations.[11]
Based on the current risk assessment of this event, WHO advises against imposing travel or trade restrictions.

Since mid-February 2025, according to data available from sentinel sites, global SARS-CoV-2 activity has been increasing, with the test positivity rate reaching 11%, levels that have not been observed since July 2024. This rise is primarily observed in countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Since early 2025, global SARS-CoV-2 variant trends have slightly shifted. Circulation of LP.8.1 has been declining, and reporting of NB.1.8.1, a Variant Under Monitoring (VUM), is increasing, reaching 10.7% of global sequences reported as of mid-May. Recent increases in SARS-CoV-2 activity are broadly consistent with levels observed during the same period last year, however, there still lacks a clear seasonality in SARS-CoV-2 circulation, and surveillance is limited. Continued monitoring is essential. WHO advises all Member States to continue applying a risk-based, integrated approach to managing COVID-19 as outlined in the Director-General’s Standing Recommendations [1].

### Description of the situation
There has been an increase in SARS-CoV-2 activity globally, based on SARS-CoV-2 data reported to the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) from sentinel surveillance sites. As of 11 May 2025, the test positivity rate is 11% across 73 reporting countries, areas and territories. This level matches the peak observed in July 2024 (12% from 99 countries) and marks a rise from 2% reported by 110 countries back in mid-February 2025 (Figure 1). The increase in test positivity rate is mainly being driven by countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the South-East Asia Region, and the Western Pacific Region.

Countries in the African Region, European Region, and the Region of the Americas are currently reporting low levels of SARS-CoV-2 activity with percent positivity from sentinel or systematic virological surveillance sites ranging from 2% to 3%. However, some areas—particularly in the Caribbean and Andean subregions in the Region of the Americas showed increasing trends of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity as of 11 May. Publicly available wastewater monitoring data from countries in the European Region and the Northern America subregion remain low and, at present, do not indicate any upward trend in SARS-CoV-2 activity as of 11 May 2025.
The reporting of COVID-19 associated hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths is very limited from the countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the South-East Asia Region, and the Western Pacific Region and does not allow for evaluation of the impact on health systems by WHO.

**SARS-CoV-2 Variant Evolution and Circulation**
SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, and between January and May 2025, there were shifts in global SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics. At the beginning of the year, the most prevalent variant tracked by WHO at the global level was XEC, followed by KP.3.1.1. In February, circulation of XEC began to decline while that of LP.8.1 increased, with the latter becoming the most detected variant in mid-March. Since mid-April, the circulation of LP.8.1 has been slightly declining as NB.1.8.1 is increasingly being detected.

The most recently designated variant under monitoring (VUM) is NB.1.8.1, which is a descendent lineage of XDV.1.5.1, in turn a descendent of JN.1, with the earliest sample collected on 22 January 2025. In comparison to the currently dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1 has the following additional spike mutations: T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. Spike mutations at position 445 have been shown to enhance binding affinity to hACE2 receptor, which could increase the variant’s transmissibility; mutations at position 435 have been shown to modestly reduce the neutralization potency of class 1 and class 1/4 antibodies; mutations at position 478 have been shown to enhance the evasion of Class 1/2 antibodies.[2]

As of 18 May 2025, 518 NB.1.8.1 sequences were submitted to GISAID from 22 countries, representing 10.7% of the globally available sequences in epidemiological week (EW) 17 of 2025 (21 to 27 April 2025). While the percentage remains low, this presents a significant rise from 2.5% four weeks prior in EW14 of 2025 (31 March to 6 April 2025). Between EW14 and EW17 of 2025, increased circulation of NB.1.8.1 was detected in all three WHO regions that are consistently sharing SARS-CoV-2 sequences, i.e. from 8.9% to 11.7% for the Western Pacific region, from 1.6% to 4.9% for the region of the Americas, and from 1.0% to 6.0% for the European region. There are only 5 NB.1.8.1 sequences from the South-East Asia Region, and none from the African Region or the Eastern Mediterranean Region.

From the latest available global data covering the period between 1 January and 30 September 2024, overall COVID-19 vaccine uptake among high-risk groups remains low, with significant disparities across regions and income levels. Among older adults[3], just 1.68% were reported as having received a dose so far in 2024 up to 30 September 2024 across 75 reporting Member States, and among health and care workers, uptake stood at 0.96% across 54 reporting Member States. An estimated 39.2 million individuals, across 90 reporting Member States covering 31% of the global population, had received a dose in 2024 through 30 September 2024, including 14.8 million in the third quarter. Uptake was notably higher in the Region of the Americas and the European Region, with older adult coverage reaching 5.1% in the European Region and 3.6% in the Region of the Americas compared to less than 0.5% in other regions.

# Medical Product Alert N°5/2025: Substandard (contaminated) oral liquid medicines
## Substandard (contaminated) oral liquid medicines identified in the WHO South-East Asia Region
13 October 2025
Medical product alert
Geneva
Reading time: 2 min (591 words)
### **Alert summary**
This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to three substandard (contaminated) oral liquid medicines identified in India and reported to WHO on 8 October 2025.  

The affected products are oral liquid medicines containing active ingredients commonly used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, or cough.  

On 8 October the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) of India reported to WHO the presence of Diethylene Glycol (DEG) in at least three oral liquid medicines. This followed information identified by WHO on 30 September 2025 of localized clusters of acute illness and child fatalities in India. CDSCO informed WHO that the contaminated products were reportedly consumed by the affected children.   

The **contaminated** oral liquid medicines have been identified to be specific batches of **COLDRIF, Respifresh TR and ReLife, manufactured by Sresan Pharmaceutical, Rednex Pharmaceuticals, and Shape Pharma****.******  

CDSCO has confirmed that relevant state authorities have ordered an immediate halt to production at implicated manufacturing sites and have suspended product authorizations. In addition, a recall of the contaminated products has been initiated by relevant state authorities.   

The CDSCO has informed WHO that none of the contaminated medicines have been exported from India and there is currently no evidence of illegal export. Nevertheless, WHO encourages National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to consider targeted market surveillance, with particular attention to informal and unregulated supply chains where products may circulate undetected. NRAs are also advised to carefully evaluate the risks associated with any oral liquid medicines originating from the same manufacturing sites—particularly those produced since December 2024.  

WHO continues to collaborate closely with Indian health authorities to monitor the situation, identify the source of the contamination and mitigate any potential public health risks.   

The products identified in this alert are considered substandard as they fail to meet their quality standards and their specifications.
How to identify these substandard (contaminated) products
See 
### **Risks**
These contaminated products pose significant risks to patients and can cause severe and potentially life-threatening illness. Diethylene glycol is toxic to humans when consumed and can prove fatal. The contaminated oral liquid medicines referenced in this alert are unsafe and their use, especially in children, may result in serious injury or death. Toxic effects can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state and acute kidney injury which may lead to death.   

To protect patients, it is essential to detect and remove these contaminated products from circulation.   

### **Advice to health-care professionals, regulatory authorities and the public**
Health-care professionals should report the detection of these substandard products and any incident of adverse effects, or lack of expected effects to their National Regulatory Authorities or National Pharmacovigilance Centre. WHO advises increased surveillance and diligence within the supply chains of countries and regions likely to be affected by these substandard products. Increased surveillance of the informal/unregulated market is also advised.   

National regulatory authorities/health authorities, and law enforcement authorities are advised to immediately notify WHO if these products are detected in their country.   

If you are in possession of any of these products, WHO recommends that you do not use them. If you, or someone you know, has, or may have, used these products, or suffered an adverse event or unexpected side-effect after use, seek immediate medical advice from a health-care professional or contact a poisons control centre.
All medical products must be obtained from authorized/licensed suppliers. If you have any information about the manufacture or supply of these products, please contact WHO via

# WHO Results Report 2024 shows health progress across regions overcoming critical challenges
## Progress on triple billion targets
## Highlighted accomplishments
12 May 2025
News release
Geneva
Reading time: 3 min (907 words)
The World Health Organization (WHO) 
The report, released ahead of the 
The report highlights WHO’s work in over 150 countries, territories and provides an update on the implementation of the Thirteenth General Programme of Work, showcasing both the achievements so far and challenges ahead.
“This report shows how, with WHO’s support, many countries are making progress on a huge range of health indicators, helping their populations to live healthier lives, giving them greater access to essential health services, and keeping them safer against health emergencies,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “In a world of multiple overlapping challenges and constrained resources for global health, these results demonstrate why the world needs a strong and sustainably-financed WHO, delivering the high-quality, trusted support on which countries and their people rely.”
## Progress on triple billion targets
The report shows significant progress on coverage with essential health services, protection from health emergencies, and enjoyment of healthier lives. Still, the progress is insufficient to reach the health-related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
On the first billion – 1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage – an estimated 431 million more people, close to half of the goal, are estimated to be covered with essential health services without catastrophic health spending. This progress is largely driven by improvements in the healthcare workforce, increased access to contraception and expanded HIV antiretroviral therapy. However, people continue to face financial hardships and challenges in immunization programmes persist.
Regarding the second billion – 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies – an estimated 637 million more people are better protected through stronger preparedness, surveillance, workforce capacity, and equitable access to tools and services, supported by reforms such as the amendments to the International Health Regulations. Yet financial constraints threaten pandemic response efforts. In the face of the H5N1 avian flu outbreak, there is a continued need for pandemic preparedness. After more than three years of negotiations, WHO member states have 
For the third billion – 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being – the report shows that 1.4 billion more people are living with better health and well-being, surpassing the initial goal. This is due to reduced tobacco use, improved air quality, clean household fuels, and access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Key challenges lie in addressing increased obesity and alcohol consumption.
However, reaching the goals faces growing challenges. Pause in foreign aid and reduction of health budgets further strain already fragile health systems, especially in communities with the greatest health needs. Financial constraints threaten pandemic response efforts. Reduced funding will also undermine hard-won progress.
WHO has taken concrete steps to become more efficient and effective, including by improving operational efficiency and transparency through digital innovation, enhanced support services, and stronger risk and security systems. In 2024, WHO strengthened its support for generating, accessing and using data paving the way for more evidence-based programming and timelier on the ground impact.
## Highlighted accomplishments
Seven countries eliminated a neglected tropical disease in 2024, reaching 54 countries that have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease. Guinea worm disease is now closer than ever to eradication.
WHO assigned 481 
Seventy million more people had access to mental health services by the end of 2024 and at least one million people living with a mental health condition received treatment.
An emergency polio campaign in the Gaza Strip vaccinated more than half a million children.
With support from the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO distributed 259 000 mpox tests in 32 countries. Globally, 6 million mpox vaccine doses were pledged.
WHO coordinated responses to 51 graded emergencies in 89 countries and territories. WHO’s emergency medical teams performed more than 37 000 surgeries and supported infection prevention and control, WASH, trauma care, and mental health support.
WHO trained over 15 000 health providers and policy-makers across more than 160 Member States on addressing the health needs of refugees and migrants.
WHO collaboration with UNICEF and other UN agencies has resulted in multiyear funding programmes in 15 high-burden countries, reaching 9.3 million children and saving an estimated 1 million lives.
Increasing efficiency, the global digital health certification network supported by WHO has now enabled about 2 billion people to carry digital health records.
WHO recognizes the sustained commitment of Member States and will work with new and existing donors and partners to secure additional funding. Securing predictable, sustainable and resilient financing is the key objective of the Investment Round, which has mobilized over US$ 1.7 billion in pledges from 71 contributors, covering 53% of WHO’s voluntary funding needs.
The Results Report is crucial to WHO’s accountability to Member States. This report ensures that funding is used to deliver impact, results are regularly measured, and future needs are correctly identified, based upon lessons-learned.

Departmental update
Reading time: 1 min (330 words)
The theme of this year’s 
Significant gaps across the HIV cascade and other health services exist for young people. These gaps are accentuated by stigma, discrimination, punitive laws and policies, violence and entrenched societal and gender inequalities which hinder engagement of and access to care for young people. 
Today, WHO launched a 
Meaningful engagement of young people is an unassailable strategy to achieving comprehensive uptake of quality services by young people. ‘’It is essential that peer driven and meaningful engagement of young people is facilitated, and that young people are empowered to take centre stage in accessing services in line with global standards and best practices for high-quality adolescent-friendly and responsive health services," says Maximina Jokonya, Executive Director of the Global Network of Young People living with HIV (Y+).
Acknowledging that the needs of adolescents transcend HIV, this document focuses on the HIV cascade as well as adolescent relevant recommendations from tuberculosis (TB), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and hepatitis B and C, prioritizing evidence-based interventions, as well as implementation considerations and research gaps that are central to the effective translation of these guidelines from evidence into practice.

# WHO publishes the WHO Medically Important Antimicrobials List for Human Medicine
8 February 2024
Departmental update
Reading time: 2 min (429 words)
The responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials needs to be improved in all sectors - human, animal, plant/crop, and environment - to preserve their public health benefits. In particular, antimicrobials that are medically important for human medicine need to be preserved by reducing their use in the non-human sectors. The WHO list of medically important antimicrobials for human medicine (WHO MIA List)__ is a risk management tool that can be used to support decision-making to minimize the impact of antimicrobial use in non-human sectors on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in humans. The WHO MIA List is created to guide international, national, and subnational (local, state, provincial) antimicrobial stewardship efforts. It complements the WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) framework and antibiotic book which provide guidance on appropriate use of essential antibiotics within the human health sector. 
The list categorizes antimicrobial classes based on their importance for human medicine and according to the AMR risk and potential human health implications of their use in non-human sectors: critically important, highly important, and important to human medicine. The publication is intended to serve as a reference tool to support decision-making by national regulators and policymakers in ministries of health and agriculture, authorities responsible for regulating, monitoring, and assuring the responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials, and professional prescribers in different sectors. 
The WHO MIA List was developed in close collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) as a joint effort to harmonize and align related guidance and lists developed by the four organizations. Best practice statements included in the document are aligned with the position of the Quadripartite organizations (FAO, UNEP, WHO, and WOAH) and are critical to preserving the effectiveness of the agents in the WHO MIA List. Further work is ongoing to harmonize guidance on the prudent use of antimicrobials across all four organizations and this WHO antimicrobial list and the WOAH List of antimicrobial agents of veterinary importance.
AMR remains one of the top global public health threats facing humanity and was associated with the death of close to 5 million people globally in 2019. AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites change over time and no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. As a result, antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of transmission to others. The WHO MIA List supports the optimized use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health.

The WHO list of medically important antimicrobials for human medicine (WHO MIA List)__ is a risk management tool that can be used to support decision-making to minimize the impact of antimicrobial use in non-human sectors on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in humans. The WHO MIA List is created to guide international, national, and subnational (local, state, provincial) antimicrobial stewardship efforts. It complements the WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) framework and antibiotic book which provide guidance on appropriate use of essential antibiotics within the human health sector.

The list categorizes antimicrobial classes based on their importance for human medicine and according to the AMR risk and potential human health implications of their use in non-human sectors: critically important, highly important, and important to human medicine. The publication is intended to serve as a reference tool to support decision-making by national regulators and policymakers in ministries of health and agriculture, authorities responsible for regulating, monitoring, and assuring the responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials, and professional prescribers in different sectors.

The WHO MIA List was developed in close collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) as a joint effort to harmonize and align related guidance and lists developed by the four organizations. Best practice statements included in the document are aligned with the position of the Quadripartite organizations (FAO, UNEP, WHO, and WOAH) and are critical to preserving the effectiveness of the agents in the WHO MIA List. Further work is ongoing to harmonize guidance on the prudent use of antimicrobials across all four organizations and this WHO antimicrobial list and the WOAH List of antimicrobial agents of veterinary importance.

AMR remains one of the top global public health threats facing humanity and was associated with the death of close to 5 million people globally in 2019. AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites change over time and no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. As a result, antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of transmission to others. The WHO MIA List supports the optimized use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health.

# Message by the Director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals at WHO - May 2025
21 May 2025
Departmental update
Reading time: 3 min (859 words)
_Kate O'Brien, Director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals at WHO_  
  

In a time when vaccine preventable disease outbreaks are surging and the health of millions is in jeopardy, 
Despite incredible progress, we must confront a painful reality: trust in vaccines is under threat, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases are rising, and funding reductions, may leave millions without vital immunizations. 
There is a growing issue of misinformation and misrepresentation about vaccines. False claims, distortion of scientific evidence, and vaccine revisionism are undermining decades of progress. This is not just wrong — it’s dangerous. It threatens public trust, puts lives at risk, and jeopardizes the immunization programmes that have protected millions for decades. 
WHO is a scientific organization, committed to using high-quality scientific evidence to inform vaccine development and recommendations. High-quality clinical trials and rigorous safety assessments are at the core of vaccine development and authorization for use. We call on the global immunization community – including world leaders, national governments and medical providers – to stand firm in following the evidence to inform policies and decisions. It is vital that parents and people who are due for vaccination have accurate information about disease vaccines are designed to prevent and about the safety, performance and impact of vaccinations. 
WHO is actively supporting countries and partners on vaccine confidence by developing tools to counter misinformation, promoting the proven safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and strengthening the bridge between science and public trust. But this is not a task for WHO alone. Leaders across sectors — from ministries of health to faith leaders and community influencers — should speak clearly and consistently about why vaccines matter and how they are safe. 
This week, WHO Member States are gathering for the 
On May 20, Member States at the 78th WHA formally adopted the world's first 
Over 100 side events are being held on the remits of the WHA including: 
  * **“Outsmarting Outbreaks: Innovation, Integration, and Investment”** – Tuesday, 20 May 2025, will explore how smarter systems, better surveillance, and collective action can stop outbreaks before they start. 


  * **“Integrating Solutions to Defeat Malaria, Meningitis, and Polio”** – Tuesday, 20 May 2025, will highlight how disease programs can work together to maximize efficiency and reach vulnerable communities. 


  * **“New perspectives for the world without tuberculosis”** – Wednesday, 21 May 2025, will review progress toward the End TB Strategy, highlight national innovations in TB care, and emphasize the need for integration, funding, and political commitment to eliminate TB by 2030. 


  * **“Tuberculosis in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations”** – Thursday, 22 May 2025, will spotlight the challenges of TB programming in crisis settings and explore innovative, integrated approaches to strengthen TB responses in fragile contexts. 


  * **“The Power of Prevention: Immunizing for a Safer, Healthier World”** – Friday, 23 May 2025, will emphasize the urgent opportunity to eliminate measles and rubella through system strengthening and the introduction of universal rubella vaccination.   



A common thread connects these critical issues: sustained progress relies on strong, equitable, and trusted immunization systems. The stakes are high. Misinformation is on the rise. WHO is undergoing reform. And the immunization community is being asked to do more with fewer resources. 
But we are prepared. We have the knowledge. We have the tools. Now, we need unity — to act together, grounded in evidence — to safeguard vaccines and the future they enable. 
Let’s use this World Health Assembly as a moment to double down on what works, confront the threats that risk reversing our hard-won gains, and reaffirm the promise of immunization for all. 
It is humanly possible to ensure even more children, adolescents, adults – and their communities – are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases.
