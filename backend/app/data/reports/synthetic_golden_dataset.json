However, in many countries, infertility \nservices and policies are not prioritized or included \nin health systems, including services or financing \n(87\u201389). Achieving universal health coverage will \nrequire provision of health financing, trained \npersonnel, medicines, equipment, infrastructure \nand effective monitoring of services through \nrobust health information systems. Ensuring \nthat fertility care is provided while upholding \nfinancial protection is essential given the risk \nfor catastrophic expenditures because of out-of-\npocket costs. People often incur large out-of-pocket \ncosts to access services for preventing, diagnosing \nor treating infertility ( 83,\u00a090). In addition, ensuring \nthat basic fertility care interventions are available \nat the primary health care  level will contribute to \nenhanced service coverage. \nReferences\n1.

Biological aspects, such as sperm parameters (#49, #50), hormonal imbalances, and genetic factors, contribute to infertility. Social factors, including cultural and societal norms, access to assisted reproductive technologies (ART), and economic constraints (#84, #85, #87, #88), also play a significant role. Psychological aspects, such as stress, anxiety, and stigma (#71, #74, #75, #76), can further exacerbate the issue. Additionally, gender differences in experiences with and adjustments to infertility (#70, #77) and the impact of infertility on men's general health (#73) are also documented. Overall, the collective contribution of these factors underscores the need for a comprehensive and nuanced approach to addressing infertility.",
