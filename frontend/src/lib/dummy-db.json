If anatomically feasible, the full dose should be infiltrated around and into the wound(s). Any remaining volume should be administered intramuscularly (IM) at a site distant from vaccine administration.\n3. **Rabies Vaccine**: Administer a series of 4 doses of rabies vaccine (1.0 mL IM, usually in the deltoid muscle). The doses should be given on Days 0, 3, 7, and 14.\n\n*Note: Do not administer the HRIG and the vaccine in the same syringe or at the same anatomical site.*\n\nDoes this patient have any known immunodeficiencies? The protocol for immunosuppressed patients requires an additional 5th dose of the vaccine on Day 28.",

No known allergies.\n> \n> **Objective:** Vitals stable. Physical exam reveals a superficial ~1cm scratch on the right dorsal forearm. No active bleeding, no signs of infection.\n> \n> **Assessment:** Potential rabies exposure (bat exposure in sleeping quarters, scratch of unknown origin). Indication for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) per current CDC guidelines.\n> \n> **Plan:** \n> 1. Thoroughly irrigated and cleansed the forearm scratch with soap and water in the clinic.\n> 2. **HRIG**: Administered 1,600 IU of Human Rabies Immune Globulin (based on 80 kg body weight at 20 IU/kg). Infiltrated into and around the scratch, with the remainder given IM in the right gluteus.\n> 3. **Rabies Vaccine**: Administered Day 0 dose (1.0 mL IM) in the left deltoid.\n> 4. Scheduled follow-up appointments for remaining vaccine doses on Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14.\n> 5. Counseled patient on signs of rabies, potential vaccine side effects, and the importance of completing the full vaccination series.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to adjust any of these details for the final note.",
